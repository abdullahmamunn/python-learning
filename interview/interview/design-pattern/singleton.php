<!-- Singleton design pattern is used when you want to have only one instance of a class for the entire lifetime of the application. It is used in scenarios when a user wants to restrict instantiation of a class to only one
object. This is typically useful when a single object is required to coordinate actions across a system, such as a database connection or a logger.

"Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point" -->

<!-- The singleton pattern is implemented by creating a class with a method that creates a new instance of the class if one does not exist. If an instance already exists, it simply returns a reference to that object. To make sure that the object cannot be instantiated any other way, the constructor is made either private or protected.

Here is an example of a singleton class in PHP: -->

<?php
class Singleton {
    private static $instance = null;

    private function __construct() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static function getInstance() {
        if (self::$instance === null) {
            self::$instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return self::$instance;
    }
}

$singleton1 = Singleton::getInstance();
$singleton2 = Singleton::getInstance();

var_dump($singleton1 === $singleton2); // true

// In this example, the Singleton class has a private static property $instance to hold the single instance of the class. The constructor is private to prevent instantiation of the class from outside. The getInstance() method is used to get the single instance of the class, creating it if it does not already exist.

// When $singleton1 and $singleton2 are compared using var_dump(), it will return true because they both refer to the same instance of the Singleton class.

// The singleton pattern is widely used in PHP applications for managing resources that should be shared across the application, such as database connections, configuration settings, and logging mechanisms. However, it should be used judiciously as it can introduce global state and make testing and debugging more difficult.
